# Why Tao?

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) lacks a recommended way to structure your frontend code for many year. Tao on Rails is the one to fill the gap which will modularize your page with the new [Custom Elements v1](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements) API.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tao_on_rails'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
