# Tao on Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mycolorway/tao_on_rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mycolorway/tao_on_rails)

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) lacks a recommended way to structure your frontend code in large project for many years. Tao on Rails is the framework to fill the gap which will modularize your page with the new [Custom Elements v1](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements) API.

## Usage

Create new Tao on Rails application with following commands:

```bash
rails new app_name -m https://git.io/vSvyw
```

Several generators are available for you to quickly start your work:

* tao:assets
* tao:view
* tao:controller
* tao:component
* tao:locale
* tao:icons
* tao:channel
* tao:scaffold

See `rails g tao:xxx --help` for more information.

## Plugin

Start writing plugin for Tao on Rails with following commands:

```bash
rails plugin new plugin_name -m https://git.io/vSvyy
```
